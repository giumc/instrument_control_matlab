function delay_trigger(obj, idleTime, channelN)

    %This function allows to set the trigger in EBURST mode, so only the first
    %rising or falling edge of the first pulse will trigger the oscilloscope.
    %OBJ is the oscilloscope interface object, idleTime is the idle time
    %in which the trigger is disabled and channelN is the channel number. For
    %optimal operation, the idleTime should be set to the modulated waveform
    %period times the number of periods you want to be shown on the
    %oscilloscope
