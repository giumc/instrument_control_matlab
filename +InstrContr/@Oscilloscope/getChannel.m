function [xaxis, waveform] = getChannel(obj, channelN)

    % This function is used to extract and plot the data from the oscilloscope.
    % OBJ is the interface object for the oscilloscope, CHANNELN is the channel
    % number (1,2,3 or 4), and figN is the figure number used for the plot.
    % XAXIS is the time axis, while WAVEFORM are the data on the Y-axis.

    channel = 'channel'+string(channelN);
    
    str = ':waveform:source ' + channel;
    
    fwrite(obj.interfObj, str) % selects the desired channel as source
    
    q=query(obj.interfObj, 'waveform:data?'); % queries the oscilloscope's data
    
    Nbits = length(q)-10;
    
    Npoints = Nbits/14; %the factor 36/513 was found empirically seeing that with an InputBufferSize of 513 elements, i got a q string of 36 points
    
    waveform = [];
    
    k = 11;
    
    for i = 1:Npoints %for cycle to extract the data from the output string
     
        waveform(i) = str2num(q(k:k+12));
     
        k = k+14;
    
    end

    xaxis = 1:Npoints;
    
    xaxis = xaxis*str2num(query(obj.interfObj, 'waveform:xincrement?')); %x-axis vector, scaled with the  oscilloscope's x-axis increment
